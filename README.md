# ReactJsCRUD
 Simple CRUD Web App using React.js, MySQL and Node.js.
 
 1. Download the zip and then import it into your choice of IDE. ( I have used Intellij for this ).
 2. Make sure you run npm install in your app directory to install react dependencies.
 3. Run the back-end by navigating into the 'server' folder through the terminal and run the command 'node index.js'
 4. You should see a message stating that the server is running and listenng on port 3001.
 5. Make sure your MySQL is running and the server is on default port 3000.
 6. Start the react website using 'npm start' in your terminal which will pop up the website.
 7. You can now add users to the database using the form and displays users on the page.
